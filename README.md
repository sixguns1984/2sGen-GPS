StQTL_2sGenGPS (Stationary temporal quantitative trait locus and two-stage genetic Granger temporal causality study) includes two novel multi-omics or multi-modal data integrative analysis frameworks (StQTL and 2sGenGPS) to identify temporal eQTLs (teQTLs) in genome-wide scale and unveil dynamic eQTLs exhibiting significant variation over time for stationary longitudinal gene expressions in longitudinal cohort studies (StQTL), and inferring temporal causality associations between longitudinal gene expression and longitudinal phenotypes using teQTLs in biomedical applications.
